INSTRUCTIONS
====================

1. Ingredient Usage:
   {'Use ONLY the provided ingredients. You may also use salt, pepper, herbs, and spices.' if exact_ingredients else 'Use the provided ingredients as a base. You may add additional ingredients if necessary to improve flavor, nutritional balance, or recipe completeness.'}

2. Ingredient Precision:
   - Specify the exact quantity of every ingredient used (grams, milliliters, pieces, etc.).
   - Avoid vague measurements (e.g., "some", "to taste").

3. Caloric Constraint:
   - Ensure the TOTAL daily calorie intake across all meals is strictly below {kcal} kcal.
   - Clearly state calories per meal.

   - Keep instructions clear, concise, and easy to follow.

5. Nutritional Breakdown:
   - For each meal, specify:
     - Total calories
     - Number of servings

6. Recipe Titles (Image Generation Ready):
   - Provide a concise, descriptive title for each meal.
   - The title must clearly reflect the main ingredients and flavor profile.
   - Each title must be suitable as a **DALL·E image generation prompt** using a photorealistic food photography style.

     - High realism and appetizing presentation
   - Do NOT generate the image itself—only the prompt text.

   - The video script must include:
     - Scene-by-scene breakdown
     - Visual actions (chopping, cooking, plating)
     - On-screen text suggestions
     - Optional voiceover narration
   - The script should be suitable for AI video tools (e.g., Sora, Runway, Pika, or similar).

9. Time Estimates:
   - For each recipe, clearly specify:
     - Preparation time
     - Cooking time
     - Total time

10. Additional Constraints:
   {'If possible, the meals should be: ' + extra if extra else 'No additional constraints.'}

11. Formatting Rules:

     --------------------------------------------------
   - Do not include extra commentary, explanations, or disclaimers outside the requested structure.
